        First of all, congratulations on the recent ruling was 1\/9 District Court of Appeals. Is that what it was? It said that what you exposed with the warrantless wiretapping was in fact, illegal. And there are many people that are calling for you to be pardoned now. Yeah, it's so much has happened. This ruling, this is actually not the first time the federal government has, uh the appeals courts have struck down some of the federal surveillance programs as unlawful. But this one is really important because it happened from an appeals court. It wasn't from a single judge. It was from, ah, panel of judges. Um, and what they had ruled was that the NSA's bulk collection of Americans phone records was illegal. And this is the very first, um, sort of mass surveillance program that I and the journalists really that the news was broken back in 2013. So this is a huge victory for privacy rights. What it means is, there was this provision of the Patriot act like remember the Patriot Act, remember? Like a zillion years ago, I dio everybody was like Patriot act patriot. Your friend Alex Jones. You know, I think he was worried about. It's a terrible name. There's a real problem with that name because if you're against the Patriot Act, it's like against babies is like like this is the pro baby act. But meanwhile, pro baby act. They get to look through your email, you know? I mean, it's like the word Patriot is attached to that in a very disingenuous way. Like calling that the Patriot Act is it's really creepy that they could do. They should have, like, a number like Bill A one. You know what I'm saying? So you can debate the merits of it. It's just so much propaganda attached to that name, like the Patriot Act. This is one of the funny things, because it should be a warning for anybody who's in, like, you know, just anywhere in the country. And they hear on the news they're talking about, like the save puppies, you know, act. There's actually one that's been they've been trying to push through recently, which is basically outlawing meaningful encryption from the major Internet service providers. Like if Facebook or Google, for whatever reason, got out of bed in the morning and they actually wanted to protect your the security of your communications, uh, in a way that even they can't break right now. Google and Facebook, they do a great job keeping other people from spying on your communications. But if Google wants to rifle through your inbox, right, a Facebook wants to go through all your direct messages on give that to the federal government, like you tap one button and boom, they've got all of it happens every single day. Uh, well, companies like Facebook have recently realized this is a real problem for them because first off, they get all these censorship demands that you've seen where, like, there's deep platform ing requests. And if it happens in one country, right? Like if the U. S government is allowed to decide what can and can't be said by this person on this platform or, uh, the U. S goes, Look, we got a court warrant, they said. A judge said, We think this person is a criminal. We want you to hand over everything you have on this person, and they do it right. Facebook does this. Well. Guess who's next, right? The Russian government shows up at the door the next day the Chinese government shows up door the next day. And if these companies don't play ball, they get shut down in that country that could no longer loan no longer operate. And so the idea that a lot of them have that they've considered and this has actually become, ah, bigger thing in the cove, it Ah, crisis where we start talking about, like contact tracing. And these companies wanna know where everybody is that all the time so they can hand this over to medical authorities or whatever. There's this idea called Aunt and Encryption. Um, which What it means is that when you send a message, you know, when Billy sends a message to Bobby, Billy and Bobby both had the keys to unlock that message, and it could be sent through Facebook. It could be sent through Google. It could be posted on a bulletin board in the town square, but without that key, which the people who run the bulletin board right? The people who owned the bulletin board Google, Facebook. They don't have that key Onley the phones at the end, the laptops of the end of people who want those they're the only people have the key. So if somebody comes to Facebook and says we want to see that information Facebook hands over the encrypted message, right? And Facebook goes well, Here you go. Here's our copy, but we can't read it. You can't either. Now you've got to actually do some work on the government side and go get that key yourself, and then you can read it right, but we can't read it. Congress is trying to stop the basically proliferation of that basic and encryption technology, and they're calling it like the Child Online Predator Act or something like that, where they say it's all about protecting Thebe posting of, like, child exploitation material and really, really horrible stuff. But that's not actually what the law is about. The laws about making it easier for spies and law enforcement to reach deeper and deeper into your life with a simple warrant stamped by any court. And the funny thing is, this never used to be the way law enforcement worked in the United States. I mean, when you hear about a warrant, what does that mean to you? What can the cops get with a warrant? Well, usually I think it means that they can come in your house and search the rial issue with warrants. And when it pertains to encryption like when you're talking about the child safety act or whatever they're calling it, anyone would say Yes, we have to stop child predators. But the problem with having the ability to use something like that to stop child predators in my eyes, I I start thinking, Well, if I really wanted to look into someone, what I would do is I would send them some malware that would put child pornography on their computer. And then I would have all of the motive that I need to go and look through everything like, say, if there are, if they were, ah, political dissident, if they were doing something against the government and you were someone who is acting in bad faith and you decided, Okay, we wanna look into this guy, but we don't have a warrant. What what are the laws? What? What can we get away with it, what we have the Child Endangerment act. And so because of that, we're allowed to peer into anything. But we just have to have motive so we have to. Well, what do we have? Motive. All you have to do is, and we both know this. It's very easy to put something illegal on someone's computer. If they're not paying attention, it's very easy to install. Like you could send someone a text message that looks like a routing number for a package they're gonna get. They click on that and then you. What is that with the Israelis?
